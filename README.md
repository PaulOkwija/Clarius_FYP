# Clarius_FYP
This repo contains the files for my Final Year project. The project is about Needle localization in 2D ultrasound images using the Clarius L7 system.
I develop and train machine learning models for needle detection then integrate them into the portable ultrasound device Clarius L7 for accurate and real time detection
of the needle shaft and tip.
